# 0x4447 Eslint Plugin for Function Padding

Custom Eslint rules for 0x4447 LLC.

# Installation

You'll first need to install [ESLint](http://eslint.org):

```
] npm i eslint --save-dev
```

Next, install the plug-in itself:

```
] npm install @0x4447/eslint-plugin-0x4447 --save-dev
```

**Note:** If you installed ESLint globally (using the `-g` flag) then you must also install `@0x4447/eslint-plugin-0x4447` globally.

# Current Rules

- **function-padding**: Require function to have padding at the top and bottom of the blocks, [Documentation](https://github.com/0x4447/0x4447-Plugin-ESLint-Function-Padding/blob/master/docs/rules/function-padding.md)
- **comment-blocks**: (Work in progress) Requires `n` amount of lines per comment block, `n` can be configured to whatever amount is given by the user

# Usage

Add `0x4447` to the plugins section of your `.eslintrc` configuration file.

```json
{
    "plugins": [
        "0x4447"
    ]
}
```

Then configure the rules you want to use under the rules section.

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "0x4447/<rule-name>": "error"
    }
}
```
